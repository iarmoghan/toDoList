## Code Explanation

### HTML

The structure of the webpage is defined in `index.html`. It includes sections for adding tasks and displaying tasks.

### CSS

The styles for the application are defined in `styles.css`. It includes styles for the layout, forms, and task items.

### JavaScript

The functionality of the application is implemented in `script.js`.

- **Document Ready Event:**
    ```javascript
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    ```
    This ensures the JavaScript runs only after the HTML is fully loaded.

- **Form Submission:**
    ```javascript
    const taskForm = document.getElementById('task-form');
    const taskList = document.getElementById('tasks');

    taskForm.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        const taskTitle = document.getElementById('task-title').value;
        const taskDesc = document.getElementById('task-desc').value;

        addTask(taskTitle, taskDesc);
        taskForm.reset();
    });
    ```

- **Add Task Function:**
    ```javascript
    function addTask(title, desc) {
        const taskItem = document.createElement('li');
        taskItem.className = 'task';
        taskItem.innerHTML = `
            <h3>${title}</h3>
            <p>${desc}</p>
            <button class="complete-task">Complete</button>
            <button class="delete-task">Delete</button>
        `;

        taskList.appendChild(t
